## Who am I?
Nice to meet you! My name is Grant Garrett-Grossman, a Computer Science major and Global Studies (with a thematic focus on Governance, Conflict, and Resolution) minor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. 

I survived the French Baccalaureate program in high school [at the Lycée Français de Chicago](http://www.lyceechicago.org/) and emerged from that fire bilingual in French and English with a decent grasp of German. You can probably find me reading the nearest book, biking, or coding (you can check out some of those projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio)).

My interests involve international security and the role computer science plays in strengthening and undermining it.

## About this site
Welcome to my website! It hosts a combination of my portfolio and various mostly tech related blog posts, musings, and tutorials. If you have to time to burn, please feel free to poke around.
